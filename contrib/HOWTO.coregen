== HOWTO Coregen =============================================================

Run `make coregen` and use the GUI to generate a core.

Depending on the output, copy .v files to hdl/ and/or .xco files to cores/.
update the Makefile.

For any .xco files, strip the "Project Options" section and the final CRC line.

After making any changes to the target chipset (eg, by modifying Makefile),
you'll need to do a 'make clean' to ensure that the coregen logic is
resynthesized correctly.
