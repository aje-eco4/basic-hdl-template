### Notes

By default, re-synthesis of a project (eg, after making a change to any HDL
files) will attempt to use the previous place-and-route netlist as a starting
point via the "smartguide" mechanism. 'make mostlyclean' will prevent this.

By default, a git checkout will update timestamps on all files under version
control. There are good reasons for this, but it can be particularly
frustrating when there are large coregen cores in a project which must be
rebuilt from scratch, even is the .xco files were not touched. The
'untouchcores' target will try to cleverly reset timestamps to prevent this;
run it after a git pull or checkout.

Changes to Makefiles will *not* necessarily result in a full rebuild; the
makefiles themselves are not a prerequisite of any targets. It is *strongly*
recommended that you 'make clean' (not just 'mostlyclean') after any
significant modifications to project settings, particularly changes to the
target part number.

### Make Targets

make bitfiles       - synths bitfiles and copies to ./bitfiles/ (DEFAULT)
make synth          - compiles and synthesizes bitfiles (no copying)
make tests          - runs all unittests
make lint           - runs lint program on synthesizable Verilog files
make mostlyclean    - cleans most sim and synth files
make clean          - cleans all sim and synth files, incl. coregen'd

make untouchcores   - reset timestamps on .xco files to last change

make isim/<name>_tb   - compiles sim files, then launches simulator GUI
make resim/<name>_tb  - recompiles sim files w/o launching GUI
make test/<name>_tb   - runs a single unit test

make par_timingan     - launches timing GUI with most recent build results
make par_fpga_editor  - launches FPGA visualizer GUI for last build (slow!)

make coregen    - launches Xilinx Coregen tool
make isim       - launches Xilinx simulator GUI (no testbench loaded)
make ise        - launches new Xilinx IDE GUI (no project selected)
make ise        - launches Xilinx IDE GUI (no project selected)
make impact     - launches Xilinx JTAG program GUI (no bitfile)
make ldimpact   - launches JTAG GUI with libusb libraries selected (Linux)
make timingan   - launches Xilinx timing analysis GUI
