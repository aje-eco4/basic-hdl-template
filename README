A very basic project template for Verilog simulation and synthesis using Isim
and Xilinx tools. Adapted from an actual project, so there is likely a bit of
unecessary flags and switches on certain commands. I have done my best to remove
everything a can where things will still build.

Build a bitstream (to upload to an FPGA, preconfigured as Spartan 6 chip in one
of the conf files) via:

.synth_project/make.sh

the toplevel ucf (constraints mapping netlist objects from the verilog
compilation to hardware resources, and place and routing and timing constraints)
is:
./synth_project/project.ucf

the toplevel verilog module, which does nothing (just sets some pins to zero)
lives in:
./hdl/project.v


Simulate with isim via:

./testbench/fuse.sh
./testbench/simulate_isim -gui


In isim, you can open the "signals.wcfg" in the file menu to reload a the logic
analyzer configuration. This cfg file will not be valid if you delete any
signals from your design that are saves in the wcfg.

./testbench/tb.v  is the toplevel testbench file for simulation.


Please improve and push!
